# ADR Creation Process

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a standardized way to document and track architectural decisions in our project. This includes:

1. The need to capture important architectural decisions and their rationale
2. The requirement to maintain a clear history of why certain decisions were made
3. The necessity to communicate decisions to team members and stakeholders
4. The importance of having a consistent format for decision documentation

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) following Michael Nygard's template format. Each ADR will be stored in the `docs/adr` directory with a sequential number prefix and a descriptive name.

### ADR Template Structure

Each ADR file must contain the following sections:

1. **Title**

   - A clear, concise title for the decision
   - Should be descriptive of the decision being made

2. **Status**

   - Current state of the decision
   - Possible values:
     - Proposed
     - Accepted
     - Rejected
     - Deprecated
     - Superseded

3. **Context**

   - The problem or situation that led to this decision
   - Any constraints or requirements that influenced the decision
   - Current state of the system
   - Why this decision is needed

4. **Decision**

   - The actual decision that was made
   - Clear statement of what we're going to do
   - Can include implementation details if relevant
   - Should be written in present tense

5. **Consequences**
   - What becomes easier or more difficult because of this change
   - Can be split into:
     - Positive consequences
     - Negative consequences
     - Neutral consequences

### Naming Convention

- Files should be named as: `NNN-short-descriptive-name.md`
- `NNN` is a sequential number (e.g., 001, 002, etc.)
- Use hyphens to separate words in the name
- Use lowercase letters

### Example ADR Structure

```markdown
# Title of the Decision

## Status

[Proposed/Accepted/Rejected/Deprecated/Superseded]

## Context

[Describe the context and problem statement]

## Decision

[Describe the decision]

## Consequences

[Describe the consequences]
```

## Consequences

### Positive

1. Clear documentation of architectural decisions
2. Consistent format for decision records
3. Easy to track decision history
4. Improved communication of decisions
5. Better onboarding for new team members
6. Helps prevent repeated discussions of the same issues

### Negative

1. Additional documentation overhead
2. Need to maintain ADRs as the project evolves
3. Need to ensure ADRs are kept up to date
4. May need to review and update status of old ADRs

### Neutral

1. ADRs are living documents that may need updates
2. Some decisions may be superseded by newer ones
3. Not all technical decisions need an ADR
